# Roadmap to Blockchain-based Governance

This document discusses the steps in developing a blockchain-based governance framework for software-driven manfacturing domain.

## GP1: The Organization -- Project Diamond
Define vision, structure, the team members, roles, responsibilities, operational details as per iCube. 
Facilitate the formation of a corsortium of manufacturers. The number of members of the consoritum is based on the **10-300-3000 model**, 
The oragnization will constitute executives, adminstrators, and support staff knowledgeable about the goals, vision and mission of the organization.

## GP2: The Consortium  -- Name?
Define a consortium of participants. The organization(In this case PD) will facilitate the formation of a consortium of manufacturers. The memebers of the consortium will engage, interact, exchange, and share their wisdom and experience to support collective decision making on proposals and ideas to promote.

### 1. Consoritum Memership
The consortium will be a (*closed*) membership consortium. The eligible members are manufacturers with specific credentials. The consortium activities are relevant and will benefit them directly. Thus it is reasonable to assume that only manufacturers (and no non-manufacturers) will join the consortium. 

### 2. Membership management
Membership management begins with the admittance of a select group of 10 manufacturers as the first cohorts. 

  - An **user interface** verifies their credentials (offchain) and enrolls them in the consortium. -- Credential Verification App.
  - Enrollment in the consortium requires a **decentralized identity on a blockchain** and recording this mapping between onchain identity and off-chain identity. 
  - Members **need a deposit** (membership fee) that can be in fiat currency(?) or cryptocurrency. 
  - The organization (PD) decides the **rules/policies to admit, deny or expel** a member.
  - The organization decides on **levels of membership**, core members. What are the criteria for core members? What are the functions of the core members? 
  - How to manage membership expansion? Can core members refer/introduce other new members?
  - The organization decides the initial membership term. 
  - The new member becomes a voting member/core member after a vesting period?
  - The consortium will be a (*closed*) membership consortium. The eligible members are manufacturers with specific basic credentials. 
  - The consortium activities are relevant and will benefit them directly. Thus it is reasonable to assume that only manufacturers (and no non-manufacturers) will join the consortium.  
  - Some branding (Member of xyz) will be assiged to the member to display on their website. (A non-transferrable license that will be revoked under certain situations?)
  - A document explaining emerging software-driven manufacturing and the changing roles and benfits will have to explained.
  - A benefits document will be provided.

The membership model is more like a American Piots association (only pilots and related-personal allowed) versus a gym membership (where anybody can join).

### 3. Member Engagement and Marketplace -- Giggso

(Example, UK Govt online marketplace)
Anyother?

## GP3: Voting and Decision Making --TownHall

An online or in-person town hall model is used for discussing proposals and voting on them by members. For example, take a vote among existing members whether they can admit a proposed new member. 

## GP4: Voting methods
Several voting methods will be implemented based the type of proposals:

  - Multiple rounds of voting
  - Weightage of vote based on stake

How to form a committee and dissolve a committee?

## GP5: Fees, incentives and penalties, rewards

Membership fees has been discussed in the **Membership management** section. Other fees/payoffs include:
  - Fees for some operations (e.g., Tx in the network)
  - Incentives for performing some services
  - Rewards for "good" behavior - monitoring network, staying member for one year, etc.
  - Penalties for not meeting requirements, for example, upgrade hardware/software
  


## GP6: Managing Funds and liquidity

  - Funds are stored in ERC20 token. Liquidity providers: membership fees and investors. 
  - Withdrwal from liquidity
  - Management of liquidity


Notes: Constraints/rules code in the smart contract -- rules will be applied appropriately
