Decentralized governance is crtical and core function for any DAO.

  - What are you governing?
- What are some compelling use cases?
- Is there a token involved? ERC20?
  - Name of the token
  - Limit of the supply
  - Who gets incentivized token
  - Who can buy tokens with fiat currency?
  - Governance token: clearly define the responsibilities ofgovernance token
  - Product token peddged to USD or not -- that is it a stable coin?
  - 3Dprinting design NFT token
- Voting is a critical component
- Payment system?
- Collateralized loan system?
- Staking 
- Interest bearing accounts
