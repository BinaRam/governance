# My thoughts on governance

Decentralized governance is crtical and core function for any DAO. 
- Fundamentally decentralized governance should provide representation for all the participants in the DAO.
- A DAO has at its core a product (s) and decentralized givernance for the product ecosystem.
  - What is your product?
  - What are you governing?
- What are some compelling use cases?
- Is there a token involved? ERC20?
  - Name of the token
  - Limit of the supply
  - Who gets incentivized token
  - Who can buy tokens with fiat currency?
- Voting is a critical component
